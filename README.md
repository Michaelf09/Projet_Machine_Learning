# Cyber Attack Financial Loss Prediction

Predicting the financial impact category of cyber attacks using machine learning models.

## Overview
This project analyzes a global cybersecurity incidents dataset (2015–2024) and builds ML models to predict the **financial loss category** based on features such as attack type, target industry, severity level, and number of records breached.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Label encoding & feature scaling  
- PCA for exploratory analysis  
- Models tested: Random Forest, SVC, Logistic Regression, KNN, Gradient Boosting, MLP  
- Final model: **Stacking Classifier**  
- Example prediction on a new cyber attack input
